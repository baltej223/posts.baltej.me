Qutebrowser – A Minimalist Keyboard-Driven Browser

- A browser driven entirely by keyboard shortcuts.
- Specifically, it uses Vim keybinds.
- Which means if you don’t even know how to quit Vim, you’re in trouble.
- It has a learning curve, but once you get it… it becomes a dangerously efficient way to drain all the joy out of casual web browsing.
