# Docker
### What is Docker, and why is it needed?
- When I make an application which runs on my computer, we can't say with absolutely surety that I will run on other machines too cause every machine is different. Docker exactly solved this, this is how.  
- There is a concept of containers, which is, Container is a single packed system which carries all the essential components for an application to run, even the OS.
- So using Docker, anyone can make an container packed with an application or more multiple containers and the container will run separately in its own environment, in its own operating system.
So basically Docker removed the effect of the host system on the application.
- Without docker the application which did run on my machine may not run on some other machine, may be your machine.
- Docker usually uses an OS which is *docker-linux*.
- Also saying containers are truly detached from the host system won't be correct, as a *bare-bone* empty container only have the OS, **still containers run on the *host machine Kernel*** only unlike Virtual Machines which even carries the Kernel packed into them.
- Containers do run on the host Kernel and not on some interface provided by docker.
- Basically docker is just **Docker is just a tool (a container runtime engine) that helps you manage containers by using built-in Linux kernel features.**

### Some Terminology
- I believe that meaning and essence of **Container** will be pretty clear to you. There is another essential concept, the ***image***.
#### Image:
- An image is like a blueprint to create a container from scratch.
- As said, image can be used to create any container. 
- You can find a lot of images on docker hub, like postgresSQL, MongoDB, Ollaama and a lot more.
- You can make an container an can then create an image of it and can upload to docker hub. And then anyone will be able to pull **image** from hub and will be able to create an container out of it to run.
