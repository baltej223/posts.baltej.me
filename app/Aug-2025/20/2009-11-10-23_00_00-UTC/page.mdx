- Something's special about this time.
- If you go to [Tour of go](./https://go.dev/tour/) and then try to run 
```Go
package main
import "time"
import "fmt"

func main(){
    fmt.Println(time.Now())
}
```
- it will always show **2009-11-10 23:00:00 UTC**
- Because?:
- The Go Playground runs in a sandboxed environment where real wall-clock time and system access are restricted. To make programs deterministic, time always starts at a fixed moment.

- They chose 2009-11-10 23:00:00 UTC because that’s the date and approximate time when Go was publicly announced at Google.

- So whenever you run time.Now() in the playground, you’ll always get that moment in history.
