# Welcome to posts.baltej.me â€” My Personal Publishing Hub

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This is the very first post on **posts.baltej.me**, my custom-built publishing platform â€” designed, coded, and crafted from scratch by me.

Here, Iâ€™ll share my thoughts, projects, tech explorations, and whatever sparks my curiosity. Unlike typical blogs, this site runs on a unique static site generator that I built myself, giving me full control over how content is created, stored, and displayed.

There will be a clear boundary between my blogs and this website. On my blog, Iâ€™ll share structured, in-depth articles and long-form content focused on specific topics, learning journeys, and tutorials.

In contrast, [posts.baltej.me](/) will be a dynamic space for shorter, experimental, and frequent updates, quick thoughts, project progress, tech insights, and anything that sparks my curiosity in real-time.

You can expect MDX-powered posts, and a sleek reading experience and Itâ€™s all powered by JSON files and smart indexing behind the scenes.

Thanks for stopping by. Stay tuned for more!

â€” Baltej
