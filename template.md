🧠 Day X – Striver A→Z DSA

📌 **Topic Covered:**  
e.g., Arrays – Part 2 (Two Sum, Move Zeroes)

🔍 **What I Did:**  
- Watched Striver’s video(s)
- Solved 3/4 problems on LeetCode  
- Took notes + dry runs

💭 **Thoughts / Struggles:**  
- Felt stuck on the optimal solution to problem 2  
- Had to rewatch the video to get the intuition  
- Still weak on edge cases – need to slow down

⚡️ **Micro-Wins:**  
- Wrote cleaner code than yesterday  
- Reduced time complexity on my second attempt  
- Stayed consistent even though I was tired

🔁 **Plan for Tomorrow:**  
e.g., Finish last 2 problems of Arrays Part 2, start Arrays Part 3
