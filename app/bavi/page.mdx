# The Holidays

- I was thiking about the holidays, that I have to properly utilise the Holidays, Many one out there got internships, many are into open source projects many are griding DSA and all are going work rightnow.
- Check for internships daily, send cold emails daily and do your work. Make a routine, no wasting time.
