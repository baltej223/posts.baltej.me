# How do I want to look and feel of the posts.baltej application

- So Frist I want the UI to be minimal.
- I will keep the UI to be black. Like the vercel blog. The github blog, cause it will also match with my portfolio.

- The navbar [fixed] should feel like something of the social media website rather than of a tech website.

# TODO:
- Also implement a metadata tag which contains the tags of which the post is related too.
- Also include a Date_ tag which will takes the date when the blog was publised
- Also a metatag which sets up the title and description of the page.
- The posts recomed system
- The url of posts should be like ./21-05-25/look-and-feel/ or like /June25/21/Look-and-feel/
