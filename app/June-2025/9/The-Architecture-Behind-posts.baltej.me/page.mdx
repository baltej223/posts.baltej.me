# The Architecture Behind posts.baltej.me

This website isn’t just a regular blog — it’s powered by a custom-built publishing engine designed for speed, scalability, and full control.

Here’s how it works under the hood:

1. **Content Creation**
   I write posts using **MDX**, which combines Markdown with React components, allowing rich and interactive content.

2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**
   I built my own SSG tool that converts the MDX files into static HTML pages. This keeps the site fast and SEO-friendly.

3. **JSON-Based Indexing**
   Posts metadata (like URLs, titles, dates) is stored in chunked JSON files (`posts.json`, `posts1.json`, `posts2.json`, etc.). This lets the site load only the data it needs, improving performance.

4. **Infinite Scroll & Lazy Loading**
   The frontend fetches these JSON chunks as needed to provide smooth infinite scrolling without heavy initial loads.

5. **Custom Post Handler**
   A JavaScript class handles fetching and parsing these JSON files dynamically to power navigation and search.

6. **Subdomain Deployment**
   The entire system is deployed on the subdomain `posts.baltej.me`, making it a dedicated space for my personal publishing.

This architecture gives me total flexibility to evolve the site, add new features like search and tagging, and maintain complete ownership of my content — all while delivering a fast, seamless experience for readers.
