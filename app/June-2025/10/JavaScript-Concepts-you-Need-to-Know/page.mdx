# JavaScript Concepts you Need to Know

- I was watching this video of Fireship, which talked about 100 concepts which every JS dev should know about, Check it out here : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkIFF4maKMU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkIFF4maKMU)

## 1. Dynamically Typed
- JavaScript is an dynamically typed language which means that no datatypes annotations are necessary unlike languages like C and C++.
- Check out this stackoverflow questions dedicated for this: [Click it](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1517582/what-is-the-difference-between-statically-typed-and-dynamically-typed-languages)

## 2. Semicolons
- Js parser will add semicolons in the end if not put explicitly

## 3. Var, Let, Const. 
- Why so many of ways to define a single variable, Cause it do with [lexical enviroment](https://medium.com/@mohdtalib.dev/lexical-environment-in-javascript-a2112b78a3cb)

- A lexical environment in JavaScript is a data structure that stores variables and functions defined in the current scope, along with references to all outer scopes. It is also known as the lexical scope.

## 4. this
In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.

The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used:

- In an object method, this refers to the object.
- Alone, this refers to the global object.
- In a function, this refers to the global object.
- In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
- In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
- Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.


## 5. Pass By value and pass by refrence
Take an example of this code. 
```
let num = 1;
let obj = new Object();
aFunc(num, obj);
// num is passed by value
// obj is passed by refrence
````
-  JS doesn't give you control of memory management, So the memory is managed by JS interpretor itself, which kinda sucks.

## 6. The Prototype Chain

- Objets can inherit properties from each other, cause of a mechanism known as prototype chain 
- [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain)

## 7. Getters and setters in javascropt classes
```
class person{
      constructor(){
       this.gender = "m";
      }
      get gender() {
       return this.gender;
      }
      set gender(a) {
       this.gender = a;
      }
}
```
## 8. Inbuilt data Structures in JS
- JavaScript have some inbuilt data structures, like array, set, map

## 9. Non Blocking Even loop
- JavaScript has a non blocking even loop, means that the JavaScript interpreter has one thread to do all the work on which is main thread.

- It does not wait for asynchronous operations such as API calls, timers, or I/O events to complete before moving on to the next piece of code.

- This non-blocking behavior is achieved through the use of web APIs, which handle these operations outside of the main thread.
