# How do I want to look and feel of the posts.baltej application

- So Frist I want the UI to be minimal.
- I will keep the UI to be black. Like the vercel blog. The github blog, cause it will also match with my portfolio.

- The navbar [fixed] should feel like something of the social media website rather than of a tech website.
