# Overshadowing In Rust
- There is a pretty intuitive concept of Overshadowing in `Rust` Which is, that you can shadow Variables in Rust, let me explain using an example

```Rust
let a = 21;
let a = 10;

{
    let a = 2;
    println!("{}", a); // 2 will be printed 
}

println!("{}", a); // 10 will be printed.
```
For actually mutating the value of a you have to use 

```Rust
let mut a = 10;
{
a = 20;
}
println!("{}", a); //  20
```

## Its use case
- That activity is left for the reader. ðŸ˜‚
