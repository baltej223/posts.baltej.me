# DSA
- Something which is asked in interviews and used as a medium of filtering students. 
- I started DSA in a full fledged way, today, at 2:30 PM June 17 2025.

## Recording progress
- I will be posting my daily progress here on my personal posts website, and occasionally on my [blogs](http://baltej.me/blog), and on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/baltej-singh-7789b4313/).
