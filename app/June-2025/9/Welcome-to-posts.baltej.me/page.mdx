# Welcome to posts.baltej.me — My Personal Publishing Hub

Hey there! 👋

This is the very first post on **posts.baltej.me**, my custom-built publishing platform — designed, coded, and crafted from scratch by me.

Here, I’ll share my thoughts, projects, tech explorations, and whatever sparks my curiosity. Unlike typical blogs, this site runs on a unique static site generator that I built myself, giving me full control over how content is created, stored, and displayed.

There will be a clear boundary between my blogs and this website. On my blog, I’ll share structured, in-depth articles and long-form content focused on specific topics, learning journeys, and tutorials.

In contrast, [posts.baltej.me](/) will be a dynamic space for shorter, experimental, and frequent updates, quick thoughts, project progress, tech insights, and anything that sparks my curiosity in real-time.

You can expect MDX-powered posts, and a sleek reading experience and It’s all powered by JSON files and smart indexing behind the scenes.

Thanks for stopping by. Stay tuned for more!

— Baltej
