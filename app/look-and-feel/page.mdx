# How do I want to look and feel of the posts.baltej application

- So Frist I want the UI to be minimal.
- I will keep the UI to be black. Like the vercel blog. The github blog, cause it will also match with my portfolio.

- The navbar [fixed] should feel like something of the social media website rather than of a tech website.

<br /># TODO: - Also implement a metadata tag which contains the tags of which
the post is related too. - Also include a Date_ tag which will takes the date
when the blog was publised - Also a metatag which sets up the title and
description of the page. - The posts recomed system - The url of posts should be
like ./21-05-25/look-and-feel/ or like /June25/21/Look-and-feel/
